# Forecasting-Highway-Car-Volumes

The goal of this project was to forecast the volume of car on a highway connecting two cities.
First through a regression on time, then through exponsential smoothing and finally through free form forecasting, where I started with the first time regression, and added new parameters. I also tried the SARIMA method for seasonal data.
